package two.chapter;

public interface PhotosInterface {

    /*PhotosInterface pi = new PhotosInterface(apiKey, secret,
            new REST());

       We get the first Photo instance from the previous
       list and then its getUrl to get the image's URL.
       The PhotosInterface class's getImage
       method returns a BufferedImage object
       representing the image as shown here:

       Photo currentPhoto = list.get(0);
       BufferedImage bufferedImage =
       pi.getImage(currentPhoto.getUrl());

       The image is then saved to a file using the
       ImageIO class:

       File outputfile = new
       File("image.jpg");
         ImageIO.write(bufferedImage,
         "jpg", outputfile);

        The getImage method is overloaded. Here, the
        Photo instance and the size of the image desired
        are used as arguments to get the BufferedImage
        instance:

        bufferedImage =
        pi.getImage(currentPhoto, Size.SMALL);

        The image can be saved to a file using the previous
        technique.

        The Flickr4Java API supports a number of other
        techniques for working with Flickr images.
