package three.chapter;

import java.io.File;

public class PDDocument {

    /*try {
        PDDocument document =
                PDDocument.load(new File("PDF File.pdf"));
        ...
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions
    }

    Once loaded, the PDFTextStripper class
    getText method will extract the text from the
    file. The text is then displayed as shown here:

    PDFTextStripper Tstripper = new
    PDFTextStripper();

    String documentText =
    Tstripper.getText(document);
    System.out.println(documentText);

    The output of this example follows. Notice that the
    bullets are returned as question marks.

    This is a simple PDF file. It
    consists of several bullets:

    ? Line 1
    ? Line 2
    ? Line 3
    This is the end of the document.

    This is a brief introduction to the use of PDFBox.
    It is a very powerful tool when we need to extract and otherwise manipulate PDF
    documents.*/
